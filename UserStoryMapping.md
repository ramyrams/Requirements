Advantages of Incremental model:
Advantages play an important role in the scope of any model.

Generates working software quickly.
Working system is producing for user or customer in early time.
Less costly.
More flexible.
Easily changes in requirements at any time.
Easy to debug.
The customer remains in touch with the developer.
Very low initial cost.
Easy manageable with high risk.
 


Disadvantages of Incremental model:
Following are some disadvantages of this model:

Needs for good planning
Needs for good and perfect design.
All requirements must clear on the initial stage.
The overall system cost is too high than a waterfall.



When to use the Incremental model:
Here are some requirements where you can use this model.

We can use it when the requirements of projects are completely defined and understood.
All major requirements with detail should define.
New technology is used in a system.
Resources with needed skill set are not available
There are some high-risk features and goals.

Hence, the benefits of using the minimum viable product examples are as follows:

Ability to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
Avoidance of the bigger failures and fund expense
Checking real-life market tendencies
Cooperation and hand-in-hand work with potential users in crafting the final product necessary
Shortest time between product launch on the market and early adopters
Gaining and expanding the user base
Possibility to attract investors early
Ability to apply for crowdfunding
Continuous product development team learning and education
Reduction of potentially wasted engineering hours

1st scenario: Typical waterfall project ­– succeeding elements are not useful separately, only the final product brings value. This approach is opposite to the idea of MVP.

2nd scenario: Many publications on MVP present this model as a correct one. However, a process where a user receives a working, relatively cheap product that fulfills essential functions at the very beginning is fine, MVP requires that the previous version should be a base for further development. The solution should be evolving, rather than being replaced – by substitution, we waste time, money and energy that we have spent already on preparing it, setting up processes and teaching users how to use it properly.

3rd scenario: a true MVP – the first step is to create a basic concept, that lacks features, but brings some value and gives the idea on how the final solution will look like. In the following steps, some processes are automated, modules and functionalities are added, changed or even replaced depending on our evolving needs and experience. Yet, they are still based on the same core (or in our example – underbody).
